# Oahu Activities

This repository lists a variety of activities, packages and hotels in Oahu. I created this database when I planned my Hawai'i trip in 2023

# Introduction

Planning a vacation can take a lot of time and effort. There's lots of things to consider - activities, hotels, car rentals and more. I created this database to help me plan out my trip to Oahu back in 2023. The data I gathered was helpful in understanding what I was able to do, and how much things cost. This helped me plan a budget for this trip.

# Target Audience
